## Introduction ##
i am a depressed college student that recently became a part of the magd program
i have uploaded the 3rd, 4th and 6th assignments from our intro class

### First Example ###
the third assignment was meant to be an experimentation with **moving objects and color.** i have three different objects moving with a limited range as you move your mouse. additionally, a line is drawn every time you move the mouse.

#### Second Example ####
the fourth was meant to test one's ability to use the **keyIsPressed and mouseClicked features.** additionally, we had to add in a **for loop.** this one took me four weeks due to strange circumstances and errors in troubleshooting. however, i did manage. anytime a key is pressed, a square is filled in with whatever color has been randomly selected. when clicking on one of the other shapes, all of the other colored strokes and/or fills change to a random color on the rgb spectrum.

##### Third Example #####
the sixth assignment was meant to demonstrate how to use the **scale, rotate, push/pop/ and print commands.** i failed to make it a specific theme, but regardless, i made a fairly simple project with scaled and rotating squares. additionally, a looped message prints repeatedly, which asks _"how many times have you cried since last friday?"_ and the answer always being "10" because that's actually how many times i had cried in the short timespan between that previous friday and the day i did the project. i like making fun of myself, what can i say?
